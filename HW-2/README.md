## Keras Perceiver
## Perceiver IO Example
## Part a
### This is an implementation of Perciever using Keras.
### The cifar100 dataset was used with the Keras model.
### Inital data preperation is done to split train and test data. 
### epochs =1 as each epoch would take approx 8 mins to finish and the colab gets disconnected
### data augmentations - normalize, resizing, flipping and zooming. 
### A feed forward network (FFN) used by the cross-attention module and transformer module.
### Patch implementation as well to extract data from the images we pass to the perceiver model.
### Finally the perceiver model aggregates the modules and patches in addition to a couple layers and is executed.
### The accuracy starts of similar to the authors execution output (5%, authors had 3%). However due to limited resources we stopped after the first epoch.

## Part b
### Using perceiver io for optical flow

## Demo
### Colabs have the results and visualisations
